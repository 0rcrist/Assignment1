4. Branches are useful when you might want to change one part of a project without changing the rest. By making a branch you are less likly to change anything ylu did not intentd. Branches also make working with multiple people easier. if multiple people work on diffrent branches then merge when they finish, this prevents problems from occuring in the master branch. 

5. git status tells you what has been added and how many commits you are ahead of the master branch. It does not tell you about the history of the project. 
git log shows the history of the project, like commited snapsjhots.

8. Inheritance is when a class will have functions or variables from uts parent class, even if they are not in its declaration. 
polymorphism means many names. in object oreant programming polymorphism is when a function has the same name but diffrent parameters or diffrent types. for example, a function Add() could take two ints and add them or two strings and concatinate them. 
encapsulation is the concept of haveing data that only certain function can have accsees to. in c++ private and public keywords manage what can be seen outside of a function.
